              Project Naptha started out as "Images as Text"
              the 2nd place winning entry to 2013's HackMIT Hackathon.


              It launched 5 months later, reaching 200,000 users in a week, 
              and was featured on the front page of Hacker News, Reddit,
              Engadget, Lifehacker, The Verge, and PCWorld.

              Ajax Animator was probably my first large project— I started it after I had exhausted
              all the free trials of Macromedia Flash for making silly cartoons in 5th grade.


              As my primary focus from the latter half of 6th grade until my early sophomore year of high
              school, it evolved through many different iterations and spun off several smaller projects.


              I started by downloading Mark Finkle's RichDraw SVG/VML drawing component and pasted code
              snippets from various DHTML widget sites until I had something that looked vaguely like
              the Flash I knew. Over the years, as I've learned more about programming, I've rewritten the
              app several times— going from raw HTML and docment.write to DHTMLSuite to YUI/Ext to Ext 2.0.


              Ajax Animator has been featured on MakeUseOf, InfoQ, and has its own Wikipedia article.

            With an ordinary webcam pointed at any flat, semi-reflective surface, 
            one can recover a finger's X and Y position with a perspective
            projection, and Z by measuring the distance from a fingertip to its reflection. 

            ShinyTouch won 1st place at the Fairfax County Regional Science and Engineering Fair, and competed
            at the Virginia State Science Fair. It was recognized by the Optical Society of America, the US Patent
            Office and the IEEE.

              It's easy enough to track objects with a camera, but cameras only record information in two dimensions 
              about a world which exists in three. Crucially, it isn't possible to reliably attain depth information
              from an arbitrary scene. However, when a flat, semi-reflective surface is observed from an oblique
              angle, one can locate a user's finger and its corresponding reflection.  That distance corresponds to
              Z depth, and the midpoint lies on the plane of the surface which can then be unprojected to uncover
              X and Y. 

              Imagine the ability to use any flat, semi-reflective surface as a touch input surface, using 
              nothing more than a simple camera.

              Cameras are powerful and ubiquitous, and many people have built interesting gestural interfaces. 
              But there is a bit of a fundamental flaw: cameras can only record in two dimensions of a universe
              which exists in three. You can vaguely estimate distance by looking at

              In middle school, I had an iPhone— but it didn't actually have cell service, which led to more than a few expeditions for the fabled WiFi.
              My favorite app was Patrick Collison's [Encyclopedia](http://web.archive.org/web/20080913191907/http://collison.ie/wikipedia-iphone/),
              which contained the full compressed contents of the English Wikipedia. It left a powerful impression on me—
              I felt the true power of a real-life Hitchhiker's Guide.

              For a long time, Google Music could only upload songs with a proprietary
              uploader that only ran on Mac OS and Windows. With a bit (literally) of 
              IDA Pro twiddling, it's possible to dump and reverse-engineer the 
              protobufs that get sent to the server to negotiate file uploading.

              MusicAlpha is a prototype of a cross-platform implementation of the uploader
              as a Chrome app.

              I spent the first year of high school mildly obsessed with Google Wave. 
              To be fair, I still think it's pretty cool— but apparently that opinion
              was a minority one. 

              One problem was that they had tried to replace everything— email,
              instant messaging, google docs, mailing lists and web pages— 
              severing their ties with the outside world. Everything was contained
              within a bloated operating-system of a web app.

              Microwave was the first real third party Google Wave client. Wave Reader 
              uses Microwave's core (magnetron?) to to publish waves as plain web pages.
